# Cloud & Automation Journey

This repository documents my structured transition from QA Automation to Cloud & Automation Engineering.

Focus Areas:
- Linux Fundamentals
- Docker & Containerization
- CI/CD Integration
- AWS Core Services
- Infrastructure as Code

All topics are practiced hands-on using WSL (Ubuntu) and real experiments.
